### Antarctic Sea Ice Extent Data Descriptions 
# advtimes 
The following data set contains the time of advance of Antarctic sea ice extent in decimal Julian days from 1980-2021 across the five regions: 
the Ross Sea, the King Hakon Sea, East Antarctica, the Weddell Sea, and the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas. The time of advance refers to the decimal 
Julian day of the year at which sea ice extent starts increasing (when sea ice extent reaches its annual minimum). 

# rettimes 
The following dataset contains the time of retreat of Antarctic sea ice extent in decimal Julian days from 1980-2021 across the five regions: 
the Ross Sea, the King Hakon Sea, East Antarctica, the Weddell Sea, and the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas. The time of retreat refers to the decimal 
Julian day of the year at which sea ice extent starts decreasing (when sea ice extent reaches its annual maximum). 

# advphases
The following dataset contains the advance period of Antarctic sea ice extent in decimal dats from 1980-2021 across the five regions:
the Ross Sea, the King Hakon Sea, East Antarctica, the Weddell Sea, and the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas. The advance period refers 
to the number of days over which sea ice extent increases (the number of days between the annual sea ice extent minimum and maximum).  

# retphases
The following dataset contains the retreat period of Antarctic sea ice extent in decimal dats from 1980-2020 across the five regions: 
the Ross Sea, the King Hakon Sea, East Antarctica, the Weddell Sea, and the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas. The retreat period refers to
the number of days over which sea ice extent decreases (the number of days between the annual sea ice extent maximum and the minimum of the following year 

# pre2006av 
The following dataset contains average daily sea ice extent [10^6 * km^2] from 1980-2005 across the five Antarctic regions: 
the Ross Sea, the King Hakon Sea, East Antarctica, the Weddell Sea, and the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas. The intent behind 
this dataset is to analyze 2006 as a year of change in the annual Antarctic sea ice extent pattern, and should be paried with analysis of the dataset titled “post2006av”.

# post2006av
The following dataset contains average daily sea ice extent [10^6 * km^2] from 2007-2021 across the five Antarctic regions: 
the Ross Sea, the King Hakon Sea, East Antarctica, the Weddell Sea, and the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas. The intent behind 
this dataset is to analyze 2006 as a year of change in the annual Antarctic sea ice extent pattern, and sould be paired with analysis of the dataset titled “pre2006av”.

# rossdecades
The following dataset contains daily sea ice extent [10^6 * km^2] in the Ross Sea, organized in columns by year from 1980-2021.
The average daily sea ice extent from 1980-2021 is also included, along with values two standard deviations above and below the mean.
The intent behind this dataset is to visually analyze which decades substantially vary from the mean.     

# khdecades 
The following dataset contains daily sea ice extent [10^6 * km^2] in the King Hakon Sea, organized in columns by year from 1980-2021. 
The average daily sea ice extent from 1980-2021 is also included, along with values two standard deviations above and below the mean. 
The intent behind this dataset is to visually analyze which decades substantially vary from the mean.   

# eadecades
